# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Arduino Project

## Overview
This project is an implementation of the Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock game using an Arduino. The game, popularized by the TV show "The Big Bang Theory," adds two additional elements to the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, creating more variety and complexity.

## Project Specifications
- **Players**: You (Player 1) vs. Computer (Player 2)
- **Rounds**: 7 rounds
- **Components**:
  - Arduino & breadboard
  - 10 LEDs (for indicator, player scores, and computer’s choice)
  - Piezo buzzer
  - Six push buttons (for player input and start/end)
  - Wires and resistors as needed

### Game Rules
- Players select their gestures using push buttons.
- The computer’s choice is revealed through LEDs.
- Scores are displayed using binary representation on LEDs.
- The game concludes after 7 rounds, with the final scores displayed.

### Additional Features
- **Indicator LED**: Signals the player to choose a gesture.
- **Piezo Buzzer**: Buzzes to indicate the computer’s choice and game events.
- **Start/End Button**: Allows the game to be toggled on/off.

## Flowchart
A detailed flowchart illustrating the sequence of actions and decisions in each game round is included in the project files.

## Hardware Design
The hardware design schematic is included, showing the connections and components used.

## Code
The Arduino and Python code files are organized to ensure modular structure and efficient logic. Comments are included for clarity.

## Video Demonstration
A 3-minute video demonstrating the game setup and functionality is provided.

## Bonus
A graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance user-friendliness, showcasing the scores and computer choices more intuitively.

## How to Play
1. Press the start button to begin the game.
2. Use the gesture buttons to choose Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock.
3. The computer’s choice will be displayed, and the round’s winner will be updated.
4. After 7 rounds, the final scores will be displayed, and the game will end.
